    <h2>Types of variables in JS</h2>

    <p>
        Three types of vaiables are there:

    </p>
    
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>var</th>
        <th>let</th>
        <th>const</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>It is Global or Functional Scoped</td>
        <td>It is Block Scoped</td>
        <td>It is Block Scoped</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>It can be modified later on</td>
        <td>It can be modified later on</td>
        <td>It cannot be modified later on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>It can be reassigned and redeclared</td>
        <td>It cannot be reassigned and redeclared</td>
        <td>It cannot be reassigned and redeclared</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>

    <h2>What is Execution in JS?</h2>

    <p>
        Javascript execution context is divided into two parts:  
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Creation Phase
            <p>This is the initial phase of Global execution content.Here all variables and functions are given memory allocation ie. stored in heap memory and values assigned as undefined.The global execution context is pushed into the callstack and it remains there until all the code gets executed.After complete execution global execution context gets popped from callstack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Execution Phase
            <p>This is the final phase of global execution context.Here code is executed line by line and the original values are assigned to the variables and to the functions at this stage. When function gets executed a seperate execution context gets executed ie. function execution which is pushed into the stack ie. at the top of the global execution context.Here the code inside the function gets excuted. After the execution of the function the function execution context gets popped out of the callstack and the rest of the code gets excuted. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Printing table of 13 using loop</h2>

    <pre>
        for (var i = 1; i <= 13; i++) {
            console.log("13 * " + i + " = " + 13 * i);
        }
    </pre>
